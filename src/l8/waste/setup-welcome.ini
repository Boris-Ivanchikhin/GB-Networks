Text=Welcome to WASTE Setup. This will install the required files and begin configuring WASTE.\n\nYou must be connected to the internet if you wish to connect to a network after completing setup. If not, you may setup WASTE and connect to a network later.\n\nIf you wish to connect to an existing network, it is best if you get the information needed ready now.\n\nThanks for using WASTE, enjoy.
